# R_project
Academic group project for the *Statistical Learning Course* of the MSc in Data Science 2023/2024.



## Description
This project is a collaborative effort between two students, **Marlon Helbing** and **Daniele Virzì**. It is an academic project that will be graded based on the quality and depth of our analysis.


## Tools
- **R**: The **programming language** used for this project is **R**, which we used during lessons. The project aims to evaluate what we have learned from the Statistical Learning course. For this reason, in our project work, we were allowed to use only methods and models presented in the course so we were not allowed to use *Tidyverse* R-packages such as *ggplot* or *ggplot2* as well as any data analysis method that has not been presented during the classes.


## Dataset
- [**Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023**]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023)): This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is a comprehensive collection of the most streamed songs of 2023 as listed on Spotify. It was chosen for our project due to our shared love for music and our domain knowledge in this area. It provides insights into each song’s attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms. This makes it an excellent resource for our project, as it allows us to explore a wide range of factors that could potentially influence a song’s popularity.

  
## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We aim to uncover patterns and trends in the data that could provide insights into what makes a song popular on Spotify.
2. **Regression Model**: This model aims to predict a song's popularity, in terms of streams, based on various features present in the dataset.


## Project Structure
- **README.md**: This file contains project information and setup instructions.
- **data**: Directory containing the dataset, *Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023*.
- **code**: Directory containing the R scripts for the EDA and Regression Model.
- **report**: Directory containing the final report and any associated graphics generated during the project.
- **presentation**: Directory containing the slides for the oral presentation in front of the class.


Enjoy exploring the project!
