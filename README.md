# R_project
Academic group project for the *Statistical Learning Course* of the MSc in Data Science 2023/2024

## Description
This project is a collaborative effort between two students, **Marlon Helbing** and **Daniele Virz√¨**. It is an academic project that will be graded based on the quality and depth of our analysis.

## Tools
The **programming language** used for this project is **R**, which we used during lessons. The project aims to evaluate what we have learned from the Statistical Learning course. For this reason, in our project work, we were allowed to use only methods and models presented in the course so we were not allowed to use *Tidyverse* R-packages such as *ggplot* or *ggplot2* as well as any data analysis method that has not been presented during the classes.

## Project Goals and Data Questions
The main objective of this project is to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) on the dataset of the most streamed Spotify songs in 2023. We aim to uncover patterns and trends in the data that could provide insights into what makes a song popular on Spotify.

Following the EDA, we will construct a **regression model** trained on the same dataset. This model aims to predict a song's popularity, in terms of streams, based on various features present in the dataset.
