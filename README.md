# R_project
Academic group project for the *Statistical Learning Course* of the MSc in Data Science 2023/2024.


## Description
This project is a collaborative effort between three students, **Marlon Helbing**, **Nemanja Ilic**, **Daniele Virzì**, . It is an academic project that will be graded based on the quality and depth of our analysis.


## Tools
- **R**: The programming language used for this project is *R*, the one we used during lessons. The project aims to evaluate what we have learned from the Statistical Learning Course. For this reason, in our project work, we were allowed to use only methods and models presented in the course so we were not allowed to use *Tidyverse* R-packages such as *ggplot* or *ggplot2* as well as any data analysis method that has not been presented during the classes.
- **LaTeX**: We used *LaTeX* as typesetting software for the report because it is widely used in academia and provides a professional look to our report, which is important as this is an academic project.


## Dataset
- [**HR Analytics Case Study**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study): This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains data on around 4000 employees and includes numerous features.

  
## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Regression Model**: In order to understand the factors that influence the number of years an employee stays in the company, we analyze YearsAtCompany based on the available features. This analysis offers the company valuable insights into which variables most significantly impact the duration of an employee’s tenure.
2. **Classification Model**: In order to understand the factors that influence the attrition of employees in the company, we analyze Attrition based on the available features. This allows the company to identify which variables most significantly affect the employee attrition rate.
