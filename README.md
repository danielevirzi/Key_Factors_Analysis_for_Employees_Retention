# R_project
Academic group project for the Statistical Learning Course of the MSc in Data Science 2023/2024

Description
This project is a collaborative effort between two students, Marlon Helbing and Daniele Virz√¨. It is an academic project that will be graded based on the quality and depth of our analysis.

The primary language used for this project is R, chosen for its robust statistical analysis capabilities and its wide range of libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

The main objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset of the most streamed Spotify songs in 2023. We aim to uncover patterns and trends in the data that could provide insights into what makes a song popular on Spotify.

Following the EDA, we will construct a regression model trained on the same dataset. This model aims to predict a song's popularity, in terms of streams, based on various features present in the dataset.
